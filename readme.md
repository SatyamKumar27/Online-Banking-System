Building an Online Banking System involves several components, including the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the user interface, and the backend (PHP, SQL) for server-side processing and database management. Below is an abstraction and explanation of the different layers and components involved in developing this system:

1. Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):HTML is used to structure the content of the web pages. It defines the layout of the user interface and includes elements like forms, buttons, tables, and input fields for user interaction.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):CSS is used to style and format the HTML elements. It ensures a visually appealing and consistent layout across different devices and browsers.
JavaScript:

2. Backend (PHP):PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor):PHP is a server-side scripting language that handles the logic and processing on the server. It interacts with the frontend, processes user requests, communicates with the database, and generates dynamic content to be sent back to the client.

3. Database (SQL):SQL (Structured Query Language):SQL is used to manage and manipulate the database. It allows you to create tables, insert, update, and retrieve data. In the case of an Online Banking Management System, you would have tables for user information, account details, transaction history, etc.

4. Server:The server acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the backend. It receives user requests, processes them using PHP, communicates with the database using SQL queries, and sends back the appropriate response to the client.

5. User Authentication:Implementing secure user authentication is crucial for an Online Banking System. It involves verifying user credentials, protecting against unauthorized access, and managing user sessions.

6. Transaction Handling:Implementing transactional operations securely is fundamental. This includes transferring funds between accounts, updating account balances, and maintaining a transaction history.

7.Logging and Auditing:Keeping logs of user activities and transactions is crucial for auditing and troubleshooting. It helps in tracking changes, identifying issues, and ensuring accountability.

8. Testing:Comprehensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and security testing, is necessary to identify and fix bugs or vulnerabilities in the system.

By  implementing these client-side and server-side components, an Online Banking Management System can provide a secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience for customers while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of financial transactions.
